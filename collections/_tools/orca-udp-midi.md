# What are all these things?

[ORCÎ›](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) is a visual programming language for building sequencers and pattern machines. It is truly delightful, addictive, and expressive, and anyone who enjoys computers that make music should try it out. For a better idea of what ORCÎ› can do, check out these links:

[Pure Data (Pd)](http://puredata.info/) is a visual programming language for multimedia. I mainly use it as multipurpose audio/MIDI/network glue when I want music apps to communicate. It's also great for making audio samplers, [synthesizers](https://www.automatonism.com/), live visuals, and [Electric Singing Bowls](electric-singing-bowl).

# Why?

Some background â€” I've been using the [C port](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca-c) of ORCÎ›, as it runs just as nicely on a Raspberry Pi over SSH as it does on my 10-year-old Macbook Pro. I was even able to build and run it on my iPad inside of [iSH](https://ish.app/), an emulated Linux shell runs on iOS. It seemed like an ideal setup â€” ORCÎ› running on my most portable device with access to all of the music software that I've paid actual money for!

Except [APK](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management) doesn't have a portmidi package, an optional ORCÎ› dependency that enables MIDI support, which meant that my iSH build of ORCÎ› was totally cut off from the rest of my apps â€” totally useless. I could have attempted to build portmidi from source inside iSH, but even then it seemed unlikely that it would be magically capable of communicating with an iOS app from inside a Linux sandbox.

However, ORCÎ› speaks OSC ([open sound control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control)) and UDP with its ```=``` and ```;``` operators, and there was nothing preventing iSH from communicating over a network!

[![osc and udp operators](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-udp-operators.png)](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-udp-operators.png)

The only remaining task would be listening to embedded ORCÎ›'s network messages and translating them into usable MIDI output â€” a perfect job for a Pure Data patch, hosted by danomatika's wonderful [PdParty](https://github.com/danomatika/PdParty) app.

# Some Issues

Initially I planned to use the ```=``` operator and send Pd messages in this form:

[![=a505Czz](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-issue-1.png)](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-issue-1.png)

as ORCÎ›'s ```=``` needs to start with a path parameter (the ```a```), and a number indicating the amount of items included in the OSC message (```5```). This was hardly ideal, as it would be in a different format than a normal ORCÎ› MIDI message, and the extra characters would add just a bit too much extra mental overhead for ORCÎ›-on-iPad to still feel like a fun time.

Additionally, Pd's ```oscparse``` object wouldn't distinguish between a capital or lowercase letter sent from ORCÎ›. 

[![=a505Czz](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-issue-2.png)](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-issue-2.png)

So only natural notes would be allowed, unless I included another parameter for sharp/flat:

[![=a505Czz](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-issue-3.png)](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/osc-issue-3.png)

where I could add  a ```b``` (flat) or ```s``` (for sharp? â€” ```#``` already being the syntax for ORCÎ› comments) after the root note. Needless to say, MIDI-over-OSC was not going to work.

The obvious solution was to use ```;``` and parse the raw binary output from ```netreceive```. Not only would this resolve the capital/lowercase problem, it would allow for UDP MIDI notes to be visually identical to ORCÎ›'s MIDI notes, just with a ```;``` instead of a ```:```

# Fixing Things

[![working patch](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/udp-fixing-1.png)](../assets/images/tools/orca-udp-midi/udp-fixing-1.png)

With functioning UDP MIDI set up to work exactly the same as ORCÎ›'s MIDI operator, I decided to address some issues I had encountered with ORCÎ› itself â€” namely the 0-indexed MIDI channel numbers, a lack of omni-channel messages, and an inability to introduce off-beat timing in between ORCÎ›'s 'frames' without resorting to weird double-time BPM hacks.

The first adjustment was simple enough. Instead of treating channel ```0``` as channel 1 (which feels like a programmer quirk to me), ```0``` would be a new omni channel (thanks to Pd), and channel ```1``` would actually mean channel 1.

# Breaking the grid

To encourage ORCÎ› to play notes a bit more loosely, I decided one extra parameter would be allowed. The sixth character in an ORCÎ› UDP MIDI message would add small increments of time to delay the attack of the current note. Determining how this timing would work with the current BPM  was a bit tricky, but I ultimately decided on steps of 1/18 of a quarter note, so that a delay of ```z``` on a note being hit once per measure would be offset exactly two beats (don't ask) and ```0â€“9``` would be a nice subtle range of delay values for expressive keyboard control.

I'm really pleased with the results of the extra delay parameter. Combined with unpredictable network latency and random UDP packet loss between iSH and PdParty it yielded something close to one of GarageBand's goofy automatic drummers, but with a looser, more chaotic style.

# More Issues

Aside from the unavoidable issues of UDP reliability, I encountered one final dealbreaker â€” sending a single ```;``` message without any parameters to my patch would immediately crash Pure Data (and often take IAC Driver down with it). It ain't great when a wrong note also kills your whole rig!

Thankfully, the mrpeach ```udpreceive``` external worked as a drop-in replacement for ```netreceive```. Only now I was unable to run my translator in PdParty at all, as it doesn't include all of the mrpeach externals. ðŸ˜ž

With a Pd-vanilla version that uses ```netreceive``` and crashes with incorrectly formatted data, and a totally flawless version that won't run on the iPad, my original intent was sort of achieved:Â a portable ORCÎ› machine that can be set to drum badly on purpose.

# Moving Forward

To make this thing more useful and to help justify the weekend of work that went into finding and almost solving all these problems, the next step for this ORCÎ› UDP MIDI Translator will be adding Ableton Link support via [```abl_link~```](https://github.com/libpd/abl_link), allowing ORCÎ› to magically change everything else's tempo. Update soon!
